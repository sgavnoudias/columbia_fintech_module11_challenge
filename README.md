Feature Summary: Forecasting Net Prophet

In this challenge, I will assume the role of an growth analyst at MercadoLibre. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. My task is to analyze the company's financial and user data to make the company grow.

    * Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic
    * Mine the search traffic data for seasonality
    * Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns
    * Create a time series model with Prophet
    * Forecast revenue by using time series models
